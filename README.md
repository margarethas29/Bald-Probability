# Bald-Probability
## Study Case
The data consists of the probability of baldness in individuals, with their information recorded including age, gender, occupation, province, salary, education, shampoo, physical condition, and other supporting factors as variables X. In supervised learning, we use regression to understand the relationship between one or more independent variables (X) and a dependent variable (Y). The goal of regression is to create a model that can predict the value of Y based on the values of X.
## Objective
Step by step:
1. Import the data
2. Perform pre-processing
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Build a model using the training data
6. Test the model and evaluate it using the testing data
## Tools
Python and Python Libraries.
